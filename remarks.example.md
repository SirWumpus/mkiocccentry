# Instructions

0.  For help with markdown format please see this [helpful guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/).

1.  Please see the [IOCCC markdown guidelines](https://ioccc-src.github.io/temp-test-ioccc/markdown.html).

2.  Copy this file into your entry directory under the name: remarks.md

3.  After reading the rest of this file, remove down to and including the line: # END OF INSTRUCTIONS

4.  Add your remarks to the resulting remarks.md file.


## Sections and subsections

For section titles you should use heading levels i.e. lines that start with `#`
followed by a space. Please start out at three (`###`). For subsections increase
the number of `#`s up to a maximum of six.

For each new section you can go down to three `#`s again, increasing for each
subsection of that section.

You need not start your remarks with a heading but you may if you wish.


## What should you say?

As much or as little as you wish.


### What helps:

- Explaining what your submission does,

- Tell us how to run your program,

- State any limitations of your submission in respect of portability and/or input data,

- Write about the types obfuscations in your submission,

- Explain how your program works,

- Tell us interesting facts about your submission,

**NOTE**: Use of humor can help.


### What does not help:

- Admitting that your submission is not very obfuscated (you see, the contest is
called the **IOCCC**, not the **INVOCCC** :-) ); but even if you do not admit
it, not very obfuscated submission have a minuscule chance to win (although
[2000/tomx](https://github.com/ioccc-src/temp-test-ioccc/tree/master/years.html#2000_tomx)
is a notable counterexample).

- Mentioning your name or any identifying information in the remark section (or
in the C code for that matter) - we like to be unbiased during the judging
rounds; we look at the author name only if an submission wins. See the guidelines if
this is not clear!

- Leaving the remark section without much content.


### Use mkiocccentry to package and submit your entry

0. If you have not already done so, register for the IOCCC and obtain your UUID username and submission password.

1. Form a `work_dir` directory into which your submission's files will be placed

2. Run the `mkiocccentry(1)` tool

**NOTE**: Use `./mkiocccentry -h` and/or review the man page by running: `man man/man1/mkiocccentry.1`

3. Answer the `mkiocccentry(1)` prompts

4. Upload the resulting compressed tarball to the [IOCCC submit server](https://submit.ioccc.org).
