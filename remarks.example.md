# PLEASE REMOVE THIS LINE THROUGH THE LINE THAT SAYS _END OF INSTRUCTIONS_

First of all if you need help with markdown format please see this [helpful
guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/).

Second of all you should copy this file to a `remarks.md` file and edit that
file.

## Sections and subsections

For section titles you should use heading levels i.e. lines that start with `#`
followed by a space. Please start out at three (`###`). For subsections increase
the number of `#`s up to a maximum of six.

For each new section you can go down to three `#`s again, increasing for each
subsection of that section.

You need not start your remarks with a heading but you may if you wish.

## What should you say?

As much or as little as you wish.

### What helps:

- explaining what your entry does.

- how to entice it to do what it is supposed to do.

- what obfuscations are used.

- what are the limitations of your entry in respect of portability and/or input
data.

- how it works (if you are really condescending :-) ).

### What does not help:

- admitting that your entry is not very obfuscated (you see, the contest is
called the **IOCCC**, not the **INVOCCC** :-) ); but even if you do not admit
it, not very obfuscated entries have a minuscule chance to win (although
[2000/tomx](https://github.com/ioccc-src/temp-test-ioccc/tree/master/years.html#2000_tomx)
is a notable counterexample).

- mentioning your name or any identifying information in the remark section (or
in the C code for that matter) - we like to be unbiased during the judging
rounds; we look at the author name only if an entry wins. See the guidelines if
this is not clear!

- leaving the remark section empty.

### Submitting your entry

When packaging your entry please use the modified `remarks.md` file with the
`mkiocccentry` tool.

**Thank you!**
