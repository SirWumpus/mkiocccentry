.SH NAME
.B location
\- lookup ISO 3166 codes, location names or print the table
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B location
.RB [\| \-h \|]
.RB [\| \-v
.IR level \|]
.RB [\| \-V \|]
.RB [\| \-N \|]
.RI [\| location
.IR ... \|]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B location
without any arguments will print the entire table of ISO 3166 codes, followed by a tab, followed by the formal location name for the given ISO 3166 code.
.sp 1
Given arguments,
.B location
tool will assume the arguments are ISO 3166 code(s) and print corresponding formal location name(s).
.sp 1
Arguments are case insensitive.
.sp 1
ISO 3166 code(s) are Alpha-2 codes: two UPPER case characters.
.sp 1
With
.BR \-N ,
the arguments
are assumed to be the formal location name(s).
The
.B location
tool will print their corresponding ISO 3166 code(s).
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-h
Show help and exit.
.TP
.BI \-v\  level
Set verbosity level to
.IR level
(def: 0).
.TP
.B \-V
Show version and exit.
.TP
.B \-N
Assume the arguments are formal location name(s) and print
their corresponding ISO 3166 code(s).
.sp
By default the arguments are ISO 3166 code(s)
and their corresponding formal location name(s) are printed.
.sp
The use of
.B \-N
requires at least one argument.
.SH EXIT STATUS
.TP
0
All is OK
.TQ
1
At least one location argument could not be found
.TQ
2
.B \-h
and help string printed or
.B \-V
and version string printed
.TQ
3
command line error
.TQ
>= 4
internal error
.SH BUGS
.PP
If you have an issue with the tool you can report it at
.br
.IR \<https://github.com/ioccc\-src/mkiocccentry/issues\> .
.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
Print the entire location table:
.sp
.RS
.ft B
 ./location
.ft R
.RE
.sp
The table is printed as a two character ISO 3166 code
(in UPPER CASE), followed by a tab, followed by
the corresponding formal location name.
.PP
.PP
Print the formal location name given ISO 3166 codes:
.sp
.RS
.B ./location AU CA UA US XX
.RE
.PP
The ISO 3166 codes may be in any case:
.sp
.RS
.B ./location CX us Gu
.RE
.sp
.PP
Print the ISO 3166 codes given a formal location name:
.sp

The location table was initially compiled on 2023 June 04
as follows:
We added all Officially assigned code elements,
all Exceptionally reserved code elements,
all Transitionally reserved code elements,
all Indeterminately reserved code elements,
all Formerly assigned code elements,
and all User-assigned code elements.
.sp
This means you will find a few codes that belong to
entities that no longer are recognized, entities
that are/were temporary, codes that are reserved for
future use, codes for Road Traffic Conventions,
codes for Property Organizations, duplicate codes, etc.
.sp
We do not list WIPO codes as they are not formally reserved.
They refer to Patent and related WIPO
organizations: as such they do not represent places
where an IOCCC winner would live.
.sp
In a number of cases, the common name is used in
place of a longer formal location name.
.sp
Because
.BR mkiocccentry (1)
recommends using the ISO 3166 codes
.B XX
for specifying an anonymous location,
the formal name
.B User-assigned code XX
was renamed:
.B Anonymous location\c
\&.
.sp
We mean no offense by this list: we simply tried to
include all ISO 3166 codes.
Please pardon any typos.
