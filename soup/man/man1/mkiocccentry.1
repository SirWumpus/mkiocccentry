.SH NAME
.B mkiocccentry
\- make an IOCCC compressed tarball for an IOCCC entry
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B mkiocccentry
.RB [\| options \|]
.I work_dir
.I prog.c
.I Makefile
.I remarks.md
.RI [\| file
.IR ... \|]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B mkiocccentry
gathers your source file, Makefile, remarks as well as any other files and creates an XZ compressed tarball.
The tool runs
.B iocccsize
and it also runs a test on the Makefile to verify that everything seems in order.
You can ignore the warnings except that the Makefile cannot be empty.
The work_dir is a directory that the program will copy the files to (under a subdirectory based on the title of the entry and the entry number), to create the tarball.
After forming the tarball
.B txzchk
is run which verifies that the tarball is okay (\c
.B txzchk
in turn will call
.B fnamchk\c
\&).
Once the writing of the
.I .info.json
file is completed
.B mkiocccentry
runs
.B chkinfo
and if there are any errors it aborts.
After the writing of the
.I .info.json
file the
.I .auth.json
file is written; once completed
.B mkiocccentry
runs
.B chkauth and if there are any errors it aborts.
If the work_dir already exists the program will tell you to move it or delete it.
The program does
.B NOT
delete it both for safety as well as in case you wish to inspect that everything is okay or do any other tests; it does however show you how you can delete it should you wish to.

.ft B
 ./mkiocccentry_test.sh
.ft R
.RE
.PP
Make
.I work_dir
and then make an entry from the files
.I prog.c\c
\&,
.I Makefile\c
\& and
.I remarks.md\c
\&, saving your answers to the file
.I answers
for future updates:
