.SH NAME
.B mkiocccentry
\- make an IOCCC compressed tarball for an IOCCC entry
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B mkiocccentry
.RB [\| options \|]
.I workdir
.I topdir
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B mkiocccentry
gathers your source file, Makefile, remarks and other files (and subdirectories) in the
.I topdir
and assuming everything is correct and valid, it will create an XZ compressed tarball which will be further tested by
.BR txzchk (1).
.BR mkiocccentry (1)
runs
.BR iocccsize (1)
on your
.I prog.c
and it also runs tests on the
.IR Makefile \|,
the
.IR remarks.md
and any extra files as well, to verify that everything seems in order.
You can ignore certain warnings but some issues are errors; if invalid input or files are provided the program will let you know more about it so you can fix it.
.PP
Under the
.I workdir
.BR mkiocccentry (1)
will create a submission directory (based on the IOCCC contestant ID and submission slot) that the program will copy the mandatory files to, along with other files and directories in the
.IR topdir ,
plus the
.BR mkiocccentry (1)\-generated
files
.B .auth.json
and
.BR .info.json .
.PP
There is a maximum depth allowed for subdirectories (4) and the basename of files and directories are restricted to POSIX plus \+ safe characters, plus a maximum name length for each directory component (38) and a maximum total pathname length (99).
Certain directories are also skipped for you, namely, those that start with a dot (.),
.BR .git ,
.BR CVS ,
.BR RCCS
and
.BR .svn .
.PP
If too many files are encountered it is an error and if the depth is too deep it is also an error.
Otherwise, if everything is in order it will create the two JSON files,
.BR .auth.json
and
.BR .info.json ,
and run
.BR chkentry (1)
on each of these files.
.PP
Before creating the JSON files or the tarball,
.BR mkiocccentry (1)
will ask you for information about the submission and the author (or authors), allowing you to correct mistakes as you go along.
Assuming everything is okay, the tarball will be created and
.BR mkiocccentry (1)
will execute
.BR txzchk (1)
on that, which runs additional checks, one of which is checking the tarball's top level directory name with
.BR fnamchk (1).
.PP
If the submission directory under the work directory already exists, the program will tell you to move it or delete it; the program does
.B NOT
delete or move it for you.
.PP
Before forming the tarball,
.BR mkiocccentry (1)
will ask you for information about your submission including the number of authors and various information about the author(s).
Once all the information has been collected it will copy the files to the submission directory under the
.IR workdir \|.
At this point it will create the
.I .info.json
and
.I .auth.json
files with information about the submission and information about the authors (which are for winning entries).
.PP
After each file is formed it will run
.BR chkentry (1)
on the file. If
.BR chkentry (1)
exits with non\-zero
.B mkiocccentry
will abort because any problems detected by
.BR chkentry (1)
based on what
.B mkiocccentry
wrote indicates that there is a serious mismatch between what
.B mkiocccentry
is doing and what
.BR chkentry (1)
expects.
.PP
After forming the tarball
.BR txzchk (1)
is run which verifies that the tarball is okay (\c
.BR txzchk (1)
in turn will call
.BR fnamchk (1)\c
\&).
.PP
Because some might want or need to update an entry there is functionality to write your answers to a file so that you can feed the program the answers quickly.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-h
Show help and exit.
.TP
.BI \-v\  level
Set verbosity level to
.IR level .
.TP
.B \-J\  level
Set verbosity level for the internal jparse library.
The default JSON verbosity level is 0, which is produces no JSON debug messages.
.TP
.B \-q
Quiet mode.
Silence msg(), warn(), warnp() if verbosity level is 0.
.TP
.B \-V
Show version and exit.
.TP
.B \-W
Ignore all warnings.
When this option is specified the program warns you that you've ignored all warnings (therefore not ignoring all warnings :) ), informing you that the judges will not ignore all warnings.
.TP
.B \-E
Exit 1 after the first warning.
This option conflicts with the
.B \-W
option.
.TP
.B \-y
Answer yes to most questions.
Use with
.B EXTREME CAUTION
as answering yes to everything may produce a submission that violates the IOCCC rules
and/or conflicts with the IOCCC guidelines.
.br
See:
.ft B
https://www.ioccc.org/next/index.html
.ft R
for information on the IOCCC rules and guidelines.
.TP
.BI \-t\  tar
Set path to
.B tar
that accepts the
.B \-J
option to
.IR tar .
.B mkiocccentry
checks
.I /usr/bin/tar
and
.I /bin/tar
if this option is not specified.
.TP
.BI \-l\  ls
Set
.B ls
path to
.IR ls .
.B mkiocccentry
checks
.I /usr/bin/ls
and
.I /bin/ls
if this option is not specified.
.TP
.BI \-T\  txzchk
Set
.B txzchk
path to
.IR txzchk .
.B mkiocccentry
checks
.I ./txzchk
and
.I /usr/local/bin/txzchk
if this option is not specified.
.TP
.B \-e
Pass
.B \-e
to
.BR txzchk (1).
.TP
.BI \-F\  fnamchk
Set
.B fnamchk
path to
.IR fnamchk .
.B mkiocccentry
checks
.I ./fnamchk
and
.I /usr/local/bin/fnamchk
if this option is not specified.
.TP
.BI \-C\  chkentry
Set
.B chkentry
path to
.I chkentry.
.B mkiocccentry
checks
.I ./chkentry
and
.I /usr/local/bin/chkentry
if this option is not specified.
.TP
.BI \-m\  make
Set
.B make
path to
.I make.
.B mkiocccentry
checks
.I /usr/bin/make
and
.I /bin/make
if this option is not specified.
.TP
.BI \-a\  answers
.B mkiocccentry
will write to the file specified in
.I answers
to make it easier to update your entry (via the
.B \-i
option).
If the file exists
.B mkiocccentry
will ask you if you wish to overwrite it unless
.B \-A
is specified which will always overwrite the answers file.
.TP
.BI \-A\  answers
Always overwrite answers file
.IR answers \|.
.TP
.BI \-i\  answers
Read the answers from the file
.I answers
to make it easier for you to update your entry.
This option cannot be used with
.B \-a
or
.B \-A\
\&.
.TP
.BI \-s\  seed
Generate pseudo-random answers to the questions
for testing an dry-run purposes.
The pseudo-random answers are written to
the file
.IR random_answers. seed
and then processed as if
.BI \-i\  random_answers.seed
had been used.
This mode is intended as a
.B dry run
only, allowing a submitter to quickly check if there are
any issues with the files they intend to submit.
The result is for
.B TEST PURPOSES ONLY
as the result is
.B NOT SUITABLE
for submitting to an open IOCCC.
.sp
The pseudo-random answers are generated via
calls to
.BR random (3),
generating strings of pseudo-random lengths and values that conform to input requirements.
The
.I seed
is supplied to
.BR srandom (3)
with an offset by a constant and 31-bit mask.
The
.I seed
must be an non-negative integer.
Useful values of
.I seed
are integers between 0 and 2147483647 inclusive.
.br
The use of
.BI \-s\  seed
implies the use of
.B \-y
and
.BR \-E .
.TP
.B \-d
Alias for
.BR \-s\  21701\ .

.SH BUGS
.PP
More than 0 humans work on it! :)
.PP
The IOCCC uses the term
.B entry
to refer to a submission that won the IOCCC whereas the term
.B submission
is used to refer to something given to the IOCCC judges for consideration when the IOCCC is open.
If the IOCCC was being consistent, then
.BR chkentry (1)
and the
.BR mkiocccentry (1)
tools would not have "entry" in their names.
On the other hand, if the names of those tools were named in a consistent fashion, they would have been named
.B chksubmission
and
.B mkiocccsubmission
respectively, which is a bit too long for a tool name, and it would have ruined the
.B mkiocccentry
pun.
The IOCCC decided to
.B NOT rename the tools
in the name of
.BR fputs (3)
backward compatibility. :)
.PP
As a compromise, the name of the compressed tarball produced by
.BR mkiocccentry (1)
was changed to start with
.I submit
instead of
.IR entry .
The
.BR fnamchk (1)
tool was by necessity changed accordingly.
.PP
Astute proofreaders might find circumstances where variables, comments, error messages and prompt strings use
.B entry
instead of
.BR submission .
You are welcome to submit pull requests to
.I https://github.com/ioccc-src/mkiocccentry/pulls
to correct such oversights in variables,
comments, error messages and prompt strings.
Note, however, that there are many cases where the words
.B entry
and
.B entries
are actually correct: they would only be incorrect if they refer to an IOCCC submission that has not won.
In other words if it refers to submissions won then it should be
.B entry
or
.BR entries .
.PP
If you have an issue with the tool you can open an issue at
.IR https://github.com/ioccc\-src/mkiocccentry/issues
as a bug report or feature request.
