.SH NAME
prep.sh \- prepare for a release - actions for make prep and make release
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBprep.sh\fP [\-h] [\-v level] [\-V] [\-e] [\-o] [\-m make] [\-M Makefile] [\-l logfile]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBprep.sh\fP runs a series of make actions to test the state of any changes prior to making a commit and pull request.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-h\fP
Print help and exit.
.TP
\fB\-v\fP
Set verbosity level (def: 0).
.TP
\fB\-V\fP
Print version and exit.
.TP
\fB\-e\fP
Exit on first make action error.
.TP
\fB\-o\fP
Do not use backup files for flex or bison if either of those tools cannot be used.
Specifically if this option is used the make rule \fBparser\-o\fP is used instead of \fBparser\fP.
.TP
\fB\-m \fImake\fP\fP
Specify path to \fBmake(1)\fP command.
.TP
\fB\-M \fIMakefile\fP\fP
Path to the Makefile to use.
.TP
\fB\-l \fIlogfile\fP\fP
Write all details to a log file and write less information to stdout.
.SH EXIT STATUS
.TP
0
all OK
.TQ
1
\fB\-h\fP and help string printed or \fB\-V\fP and version string printed
.TQ
2
command line error
.TQ
3
Makefile not readable file
.TQ
4
could not make writable log file
.TQ
9
internal error
.TQ
>= 10
some make action exited non-zero
.SH NOTES
.PP
There are two ways that this script should be invoked in order of preference:
.TP
.B make release
run the script with the \fB\-e\fP and \fB\-o\fP options.
.TQ
.B make prep
run the script without exiting on the first error and allowing flex or bison backup files
.PP
Although the \fBmake release\fP should be used first it is okay to use \fBmake prep\fP to get a summary of all issues to fix.
However the \fBmake release\fP generally should pass before a commit (if one does not modify the jparse files then one can probably get away with not using \fBmake release\fP).
.PP
This script is only needed for the repo maintainers prior to a commit and pull request.
.PP
.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
.nf
Run the script in a way that aborts on the first error including the inability to use \fBbison\fP or \fBflex\fP.
.RS
\fB
 make release\fP
.RE
.PP
.nf
Run the script in a more lenient way, specifying a log file to reduce output on stdout:
.RS
\fB
 make prep\fP
.RE

\fBbison(1)\fP, \fBflex(1)\fP, \fBmake(1)\fP
