/*
 * jprint_util - utility functions for JSON printer jprint
 *
 * "Because specs w/o version numbers are forced to commit to their original design flaws." :-)
 *
 * This tool is being developed by:

 *	@xexyl
 *	https://xexyl.net		Cody Boone Ferguson
 *	https://ioccc.xexyl.net
 *
 * The JSON parser was co-developed in 2022 by Cody and Landon.
 *
 * "Because sometimes even the IOCCC Judges need some help." :-)
 *
 * "Share and Enjoy!"
