We have this todo list for the JSON tools `jfmt`, `jval` and `jnamval` as a way
to make it easier for everyone to update the list. Once everything is done this
file can be removed. We will try and not duplicate entries but it's entirely
possible that there will be duplicates.

* Add to `jval(1)` the **IMPORTANT NOTE** about JSON levels discussed in the
[json_util_README.md](./json_util_README.md) document.
