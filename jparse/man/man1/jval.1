.SH DESCRIPTION
.B jval
parses a JSON file,
.IR file.json ,
and if it is valid will print values that match or, if the
.B \-i
option is specified, values that do not match.
By default the program looks for whole matches but with the
.B \-s
option it can look for substrings and with the
.B \-g
option it can use grep\-like regular expressions.
If no arg other than the file is specified then all values match.
By default the tool writes the output to stdout but if you use the
.B \-o
option you can change this behaviour (\- means stdout).
The
.B \-m
option allows you to change the default depth to traverse when parsing the JSON where the default is set to a reasonable value for most cases (256 equivalent to the
.BR JSON_DEFAULT_MAX_DEPTH ).
.PP
The option
.B \-t
controls what types to search for, excluding matches if they are not any of the types in the comma-separated list.
The option
.B \-l
allows you to restrict the output based on the JSON level.
The option
.B \-L
tells the program to print the JSON level followed by a given number of spaces or tabs where the default is 4 spaces.
.B \-I
allow for indenting the levels with a default value of 4 spaces.
The option
.B \-n
allows for finding values based on different comparison modes like equality, less than, less than or equal to and so on.
The
.B \-S
option allow for comparing strings lexicographically in a similar way as to what
.B \-n
does with numbers.
As these options are more complicated in form we describe them and the rest in more detail in the
.B OPTIONS
section below.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-h
Show help and exit.
.TP
.B \-V
Show version and exit.
.TP
.BI \-v\  level
Set verbosity level to
.IR level
(def: 0).
.TP
.BI \-J\  level
Set JSON verbosity level to
.IR level
(def: 0).
.TP
.B \-q
Suppress some of the output (def: show more information).
.TP
.BI \-L\   <num>[{t|s}
Print the JSON levels followed by the number of spaces or tabs, depending on the letter specified,
.BR T
for tabs and
.BR S
for spaces.
Not specifying either defaults to spaces.
As a convenience, specifying
.BI \-L\  tab
is an alias for
.BI \-L\  1t\c
\&.
.TP
.BI \-t\  type
Match only the comma separated types (def: simple).
.RS
.B int
.RS
integer values
.RE
.B float
.RS
floating point values
.RE
.B exp
.RS
exponential notation values
.RE
.B num
.RS
alias for int,float,exp
.RE
.B bool
.RS
boolean values
.RE
.B str
.RS
string values
.RE
.B null
.RS
null values
.RE
.B simple
.RS
alias for num,bool,str,null (the default)
.RE
.RE
.TP
.BI \-l\  lvl
Only show JSON members in the given level range (def: show all levels).
.sp
.RS
If
.I lvl
is a number (e.g.: \-l 3), level must == number.
.br
If
.I lvl
is a number followed by : (e.g. '\-l 3:'), level must be >= number.
.br
If
.I lvl
is a : followed by a number (e.g. '\-l :3'), level must be <= number.
.br
If
.I lvl
is num:num (e.g. '\-l 3:5'), level must be inclusively in the range.
.RE
.TP
.B \-Q
Print JSON strings surrounded by double quotes (def: do not).
.TP
.B \-D
Print JSON strings as decoded strings (def: print JSON strings as encoded strings).
.TP
.B \-d
Match the JSON decoded values (def: match as given in the JSON document).
.TP
.B \-i
Invert match: print values that do not match (def: print values that do match).
.TP
.B \-s
Match substrings (def: match entire values).
.TP
.B \-f
Fold (ignore) case (def: case matters when matching strings).
.TP
.B \-c
Print total match count only (def: print values).
Using \-c with either \-C or \-L is an error.
.TP
.B \-C
Print match count followed by matched value (def: print values).
Using \-C with either \-c or \-L is an error.
.TP
.B \-g
Match using grep\-like extended regular expressions (def: match strings or substrings if \-s)
To match from the beginning, start arg with '^'.
To match to the end, end arg with '$'.
Using \-g with \-s is an error.
.TP
.B \-e
Print JSON strings as encoded strings (def: decode JSON strings).
.TP
.BI \-n\   op=num
Match if numeric comparison op with num is true (def: do not).
Op may be one of the following:
.RS
.TQ
.B eq
equal to
.RE
.RS
.TQ
.B lt
less than
.RE
.RS
.TQ
.B le
less than or equal to

.RS
.TQ
.B gt
greater than
.RE
.RS
.TQ
.B ge

.TP
.BI \-S\   op=str
Match if lexicographical comparison op with string is true (def: do not).
Op may be one of the following:
.RS
.TQ
.B eq
equal to
.RE

.TP
.BI \-o\  ofile
Write to ofile (def: stdout)
.TP
.BI \-m\  max_depth
Set maximum traversal depth when parsing the JSON document.
The default is defined as the macro
.BI JSON_DEFAULT_MAX_DEPTH ,
256.
Specifying 0 means infinite depth: only safe with infinite time, variable size and RAM! :-)
.TP
.B \-K
Run built\-in test suite of some features.
.TP
.BI \-o\  ofile
Write output to specified file.
.RS
If the file already exists (case-insensitive) it is an error.
.br
If the file cannot be opened for writing it is also an error.
.br

.BR \- .

.SH NOTES
.PP
The JSON parser was written as a collaboration between Cody Boone Ferguson and Landon Curt Noll, one of the IOCCC Judges, to support
IOCCCMOCK, IOCCC28 and beyond.
.PP
.BR jval (1)
is being developed by Cody Boone Ferguson.
.PP
For more detailed history that goes beyond this humble man page we recommend you check
.BR jval (1),
.IR CHANGES.md ,
.IR README.md ,
the GitHub git log as well as reading the source code (or not :\-) ).
.PP
We don't recommend you check the GitHub issue page! :\-)
This is because it's incredibly long with a lot of OT things and would take even the fastest readers a very long time to read. :\-(
.PP
.SH BUGS
.PP
It is currently incomplete and listing the missing features and things that are not correct is not worth the time or effort.
.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
Print all values in a
.I h2g2.json
if valid JSON by not specifying an arg:
.sp
.RS
.ft B
jval h2g2.json
.ft R
.RE
.PP
For every value in the file
.BR h2g2.json
print the level of each value followed by 4 spaces followed by the value itself:
.sp
.RS
.ft B
jval -L 4s h2g2.json
.ft R
.RE
.sp
This is a useful way to better understand JSON levels.
.PP
Print string values in double quotes in the file h2g2.json:
.sp
.RS
.ft B
jval -Q h2g2.json
.ft R
.RE
.PP
Only print integer values in the file jparse/test_jparse/test_JSON/good/top_level_array.json:
.sp
.RS
.ft B
jval -Q -t int jparse/test_jparse/test_JSON/good/top_level_array.json
.ft R
.RE
