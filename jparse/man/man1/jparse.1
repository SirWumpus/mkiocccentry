.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBjparse\fP parses a block of JSON text either from a file (\fB\-\fP means \fBstdin\fP) or a string passed to the program via the \fB\-s\fP option, reporting if it is valid or invalid JSON.
Depending on the JSON verbosity level it will also show more information.
This tool by itself is useful to validate JSON but the \fBjparse(3)\fP API is much more useful in general as it allows for one to actually do things with the JSON.

.SH NOTES
.PP
This JSON parser was written as a collaboration between Cody Boone Ferguson and Landon Curt Noll, one of the IOCCC Judges, to support \fBIOCCCMOCK\fP, \fBIOCCC28\fP and beyond.
.PP
For more detailed history that goes beyond this humble man page we recommend you check \fBjparse(1)\fP, \fBchkentry(1)\fP, \fICHANGES.md\fP, \fIREADME.md\fP, the GitHub git log as well as reading the source code (or not :\-) ).
Understand that by source we refer to the \fIjparse.l\fP and \fIjparse.y\fP files: we do NOT recommend you read the generated code!
This is because doing so is likely to give you nightmares and cause other horrible symptoms.
See the apology at the top of the generated files or look directly at \fIsorry.tm.ca.h\fP instead.
.PP
We don't recommend you check the GitHub issue page! :\-)
This is because it's incredibly long with a lot of OT things and would take even the fastest readers a very long time to read. :\-(

.SH BUGS
.PP
Although error reporting does have locations it is only line numbers and columns.
Additionally the column can be misleading because of characters that take up more than one column but are counted as just one (tabs for example).
.PP
Although the scanner and parser are re-entrant only one parse at one time in a process has been tested.
The testing of more than one parse at the same time is way out of scope of this repo but will be tested more as I move this to a separate repo.
.PP
If it's not clear this means that having more than one parse active in the same process at the same time is not tested so even though it should be okay there might be some issues that have yet to be discovered.
.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
.nf
Parse the JSON string \fB{ "test_mode" : false }\fP:
.RS
\fB
 ./jparse \-s '{ "test_mode" : false }'\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
.nf
Parse input from \fBstdin\fP (send \fBEOF\fP, usually ctrl\-d or \fB^D\fP, to parse):
.RS
\fB
 ./jparse \-
 []
 ^D\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
.nf
Parse just a negative number:
.RS
\fB
 ./jparse \-s \-\- \-5\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
.nf
Parse .info.json file:
.RS
\fB
 ./jparse .info.json\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
.nf
Run the \fBjparse_test.sh\fP script using the default \fIjson_teststr.txt\fP file with verbosity set at 5:
.RS
