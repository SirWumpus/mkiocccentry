.SH NAME
all_ref.sh \- form \fI*.json.c\fP and \fI*.json.h\fP semantic table files
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBall_ref.sh\fP [\-h] [\-v level] [\-V] [\-j jsemcgen.sh] info.head.c info.tail.c info.head.h info.tail.h auth.head.c auth.tail.c auth.head.h auth.tail.h info_dir auth_dir ref_dir
.SH DESCRIPTION
This tool forms semantic table files under a given directory which is important for the \fBchkentry(1)\fP tool.
As \fBchkentry(1)\fP is a vitally important part of the IOCCC judging process this tool, along with \fBjsemcgen(8)\fP and \fBjsemtblgen(8)\fP are vital in running the IOCCC but at a lower level.
.PP
The \fIinfo.head.c\fP file is a \fI.info.json\fP style header for .c semantic table files.
.br
The \fIinfo.tail.c\fP file is a \fI.info.json\fP style trailer for .c semantic table files.
.br
The \fIinfo.head.h\fP file is a \fI.info.json\fP style header for .h semantic table files.
.br
The \fIinfo.tail.h\fP file is a \fI.info.json\fP style trailer for .h semantic table files.
.PP
The \fIauth.head.c\fP file is a \fI.auth.json\fP style header for .c semantic table files.
.br
The \fIauth.tail.c\fP file is a \fI.auth.json\fP style trailer for .c semantic table files.
.br
The \fIauth.head.h\fP file is a \fI.auth.json\fP style header for .h semantic table files.
.br
The \fIauth.tail.h\fP file is a \fI.auth.json\fP style trailer for .h semantic table files.
.PP
The \fIinfo_dir\fP directory is expected to have \fI*.json\fP files as \fI.info.json\fP files.
.br
The \fIauth_dir\fP directory is expected to have \fI*.json\fP files as \fI.auth.json\fP files.
.br
The \fIref_dir\fP directory is a subdirectory under which the semantic table files are written.

.SH NOTES
.PP
The JSON parser \fBjparse\fP was co\-developed by Cody Boone Ferguson and Landon Curt Noll (one of the IOCCC Judges) in support for IOCCCMOCK, IOCCC28 and beyond.
.PP
This tool is needed in order to generate the JSON semantics table for \fBchkentry(1)\fP.
.SH BUGS
