/*
 * A programmer's apology
 *
 * Sorry (tm Canada :-)) for the appalling condition of the code below.
 *
 * The people who worked on this repo did NOT write that code.
 * Instead, that code was generated by the bison or flex code generator.
 *
 * We do NOT recommend that you modify this code even though it's incredibly
 * offensive and ugly but instead work on the bison *.y and flex *.l source
 * files. See the Makefile for more information on how this file was generated.
 *
 * Thanks in advance for your understanding, and sorry (tm Canada :-)).
