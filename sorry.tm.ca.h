/*
 * A programmer's apology
 *
 * Sorry (tm Canada :-)) for the appalling condition of the code below.
 *
 * The people who worked on this repo did NOT write his code.  Well,
 * OK, we did write this comment. But we refer to code beyond this comment. :-)
 *
 * The code below was generated by the bison or flex code generator.
 * We do NOT recommend that you modify this code even though it's incredibly
 * offensive and ugly but instead work on the bison *.y and flex *.l source
 * files. See the Makefile for more info on how the code below was generated.
 *
 * Thanks in advance for your understanding, and sorry (tm Canada :-)).
 *
 * P.S. In 2022 April 04, when this comment was created, none of the people
 *	working on this repo were Canadian.  But some of them have several
 *	good friends who live in, or are from Canada. Those friends say sorry
 *	in a fun and friendly way, so we honor those friends in this comment.
