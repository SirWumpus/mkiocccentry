/*
 * A programmer's apology and warning
 *
 * Sorry (tm Canada :-)) for the appalling condition of the code below.
 *
 * The people who worked on this repo did NOT write this code. Well, OK, we DID
 * write this comment. We refer to code beyond this comment. The code below
 * was generated by the bison or flex code generators.
 *
 * WARNING: We do NOT recommend that you modify the generated code even though
 * it is digitally odoriferous and has a gleety appearance. Beautification of
 * this code, no matter how disagreeable it may seem, is unwise as such
 * modifications tend to be practically impossible to maintain. Even if this
 * Flying Spaghetti Monster style code tempts you to tweak it, doing so might
 * produce visions and nightmares of Cthulhu-like tentacles grabbing at the very
 * logic of your mind, pulling it down into a hideous maelstrom of code
 * maintenance cacophony.
 *
 * OK, it might not give you nightmares but why take the risk? The point is
 * don't work on this file! Instead work on the bison and flex related source
 * files. See the Makefile for details on how this file was generated.
 *
 * Now some might be tempted to point out this code is in support of the
 * International Obfuscated C Code Contest (IOCCC) and that objecting to the
 * output of Bison and Flex borders on programming sanctimoniousness. At first
 * glance, this incongruence is unsustainable. In response we opine that one of
 * the fundamental undertones of the IOCCC are the promotion of good programming
 * through the irony awarding highly obfuscated C code. So, if it helps, we
 * suggest you view this apology in a satirical light, even if you are humour
 * impaired. Nevertheless, we still recommend you to eschew modifying the code
 * below.
 *
 * BTW: If you don't agree with us that it's ugly we want to point out that it
 * even admits it and we ask you why it would call itself ugly if it's not. :-)
 *
 * Thanks in advance for your understanding, and sorry (tm Canada :-)).
 *
 * Of course, on the other hand, the fact the parser IS for JSON might suggest
 * that the parser SHOULD be ugly and since IT IS UGLY this apology might be
 * superfluous. If one were to ignore the fact that bison and flex do not care
 * what they are parsing this same person could argue, obviously by some
 * perverted logical fallacies, that bison and flex did their job well. :-) This
 * logic is as barmy as JSON, though, and so we must still say we're sorry.
 *
 * P.S. In 2022 April 04, when this comment was initially formed, none of the
 *	people working on this repo were Canadian. But some of them have
 *	several	good friends who live in, or are from Canada. Those friends
 *	say sorry in a fun and friendly way, so we honour those friends
 *	accordingly.
