# A temporary todo list of known things to check and/or do
*Last updated: Sun Aug  6 17:17:53 UTC 2023*

This document is a list of things to do that are not specific to any particular
issue that is open.

- Add to the FAQ how to find country codes for submitting entries and more
generally as the `location` tool is rather useful.

- Make options list for `jfmt`, `jval` and `jnamval` the same order in both
tools and the usage strings. It might be better to do this after the specs are
finalised as new options have been introduced or have been changed as discussion
is had which is part of the problem here.
